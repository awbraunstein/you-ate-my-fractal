* Fractals?
  Yes, this will be a parameterized fractal generator and zoomer. It
  will also be written in haskell(WOOOOOOT).

* How will recursion be used?
  Even though much of the code will not be recursive, the coloring of
  the fractals as well as computing the points will be done
  recursively. Also, I believe that I will discover more about the
  nature of recursion and how it relates to art and mathematical
  functions.

* Goals
  - A zoomer that will explore the Mandelbrot sets and the Julia
    Sets(if I have time)
  - Using the GPU (GPipe) I will create beautifully rendered recursive
    art.
  - The fractals will be generated using input from the user. 
    - iterations
    - x-dimension
    - y-dimension
    - pixels
    - color scheme
    - max recursion depth
  - Beautiful images and flyovers that my mother would be proud to put
    on the fridge
